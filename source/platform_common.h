    /* NOTE: [2026-02-13 Fri 17:05] Maybe instead of trying to randomally call
       single functions it would be better to register callbacks for this
       event. I have devised this platform_event structure of all possible
       platform_specific functions. Crude, but should work. It would also be
       more performant than blind message passing.

       NOTE: [2026-02-13 Fri 21:05] I don't really think this is a good idea, it
       complicats managements of platform layers / subsystems which leads to
       duplicate of code and boilerplate and complicated when trying bind and
       unbind events. Instead I should go back to the unified 'platform_procs'
       interface to added onto a list and use that as an "event driver", then it
       can be removed or disabled at will. I'm modify it slightly to carry some
       context with it. */
